# It starts here
This is where my journey begins as a Java Software Engineer. To master the language, ecosystem and tools it has to offer.

I have not been programming for some time and in order to achieve my goal in becoming a Java Software Engineer, I will need to work really hard.

Going through Google Gemini to help me build a list of projects and being able to specify what I could learn from them. I have asked to make 150 different projects in a range of complexity.

Here is category 1, a list a of 20 projects to get me started in the journey.


# Projects
