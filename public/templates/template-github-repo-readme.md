## üöÄ Project Overview

Provide a concise, high-level description of your project. What does it do? What problem does it solve? What was your primary goal in building it?

*Example:* This project is a **Personal Finance Tracker** developed in Java. It allows users to record income and expenses, categorize transactions, and generate basic financial reports to help manage personal finances effectively.

---

## ‚ú® Features

List the key functionalities and features of your application. Use bullet points for clarity.

* **User Authentication:** Secure user login and registration (for web applications).
* **Transaction Management:** Add, view, update, and delete income and expense transactions.
* **Categorization:** Assign categories (e.g., 'Groceries', 'Salary', 'Rent') to transactions.
* **Reporting:** Generate monthly/yearly summaries of income and expenses.
* **Data Persistence:** Store all financial data in a PostgreSQL database.
* **Intuitive User Interface:** A simple command-line interface (CLI) or a responsive web interface built with Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Enumerate all the major technologies, frameworks, and tools employed in your project. Include specific versions if relevant.

* **Language:** Java 17
* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.2.x (for web projects)
* **Build Tool:** Maven 3.x
* **Database:** PostgreSQL 15 (or H2 Database for local development/testing)
* **ORM:** Spring Data JPA / Hibernate
* **Web Frontend (if applicable):** Thymeleaf / HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript (or specific JS framework like React/Angular)
* **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito
* **Other Libraries:**
    * Lombok (for boilerplate reduction)
    * Jackson (for JSON processing)
    * SLF4J + Logback (for logging)
    * (Add any other specific libraries or APIs used, e.g., Apache Commons, external APIs)

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Briefly explain the architecture of your application. A simple diagram or a description of the layers is highly beneficial for more complex projects.

*Example (for a typical Spring Boot app):*

This application follows a **layered architecture** based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for web interfaces, or a Controller-Service-Repository pattern for RESTful APIs.

* **Presentation Layer (Controllers):** Handles incoming HTTP requests, performs input validation, and orchestrates responses.
* **Service Layer (Services):** Contains the core business logic, orchestrating interactions between different components and handling transactional operations.
* **Data Access Layer (Repositories):** Manages data persistence, interacting with the database using Spring Data JPA.
* **Model Layer (Entities/DTOs):** Represents the data structures used throughout the application, including database entities and Data Transfer Objects for API communication.

*(Optional: Include a simple diagram if it clarifies complex relationships, e.g., a Mermaid diagram or a link to an image.)*

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for setting up and running your project locally. Be precise about prerequisites.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
* Maven 3.x
* (If using a database) PostgreSQL installed and running
* (Optional) An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Setup Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```

2.  **Database Configuration (if applicable):**
    * Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running.
    * Create a new database for this project (e.g., `finance_tracker_db`).
    * Update the database connection properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties` (or `application.yml`):
        ```properties
        spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/finance_tracker_db
        spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
        spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
        spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update # or create for first run
        ```

3.  **Build the Project:**
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

4.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    java -jar target/your-project-name-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```

### Accessing the Application

* **For RESTful API projects:** The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the endpoints. (Optional: Include a link to a Postman Collection export if you created one.)
* **For Web UI projects:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
* **For Console applications:** Run the `.jar` file as shown above, and interact with it via your console/terminal.

---

## üß™ Testing

Explain how to run the tests and what type of tests are included (unit, integration).

* **Run All Tests:**
    ```bash
    mvn test
    ```
* **Types of Tests:**
    * **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components (e.g., service methods, utility functions) in isolation.
    * **Integration Tests:** Verify the interaction between different layers (e.g., service and repository layers with an in-memory database like H2).

---

## üìà Future Enhancements

List ideas for future development or features you'd like to add. This demonstrates foresight and a continuous improvement mindset.

* Implement user roles (e.g., Admin, Regular User).
* Add multi-currency support.
* Integrate with a third-party payment gateway API (mocked for security).
* Develop a more sophisticated reporting module with charts and graphs.
* Migrate to a cloud deployment platform (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku).
* Add Dockerization for easier deployment.
